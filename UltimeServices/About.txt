This sample shows the basic Command usage on TopSolid.

> How the TopSolid commands are working?




1. UI project

	The UI project has a specific organisation:
		- A ContextMenu.cs file (to define where the Addin menu will be displayed)
		- A ContextMenu.Item.ico file (Icon of the Addin)
		- A ContextMenu.xml file (to define the Addin menu organisation)
		- A Resources.cs file (for the translations)
		- A Session.cs file (to execute code at TopSolid start and close)


2. Command definition

	A Command is a derivated class on an addin.
	It is located on the UI part of the Addin (in general on a Command folder or in a folder with the Command function).

	A command contains several files:
		- C# Command file with the Command methods (see the §3 for more information)
		- Resources file with the Command translations (1 per language)
		- [Optional] Icon file with the same name of the Command (it is the Command icon used on the TopSolid GUI)
		

3. Command works

	In a Command, you have to override the base command methods or properties.
	
	The CanInvoke property returns a boolean to define if the Command is active or not. This code is often evaluated so it shall run quickly (avoid huge researchs).
	The Invoke method defines the Execution method when the Command is invoked.
